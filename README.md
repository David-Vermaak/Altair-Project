# Airline Seat Optimization Project

A senior design project focused on optimizing airline seat weight using Altair Inspire for structural optimization. This project aims to reduce aircraft weight while maintaining safety standards and passenger comfort.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the application of structural optimization techniques in aircraft seating design. Using Altair Inspire, we've developed a methodology to optimize seat components while ensuring compliance with aviation safety standards.

### Key Features

- Structural optimization using Altair Inspire
- Weight reduction analysis
- Safety compliance validation
- Cost efficiency improvements
- Comprehensive technical documentation
